    "content" : "Huzzah! After pushing for a while and getting caught on a few speed-bumps, the game rooms have a working chat system that allows up-to-date information between the two players. If you haven't already, go check it out; it's pretty gnar. The chat system takes avantage of the server-side technique \"long polling\" to push events and updated data back to the client through xhr calls. Basically, the client opens up a \"socket\" to the server by calling a specific url with and xhr call. When the server receives the xhr call, it chills out inside a while loop untill it detects something has changed. To detect a change, each iteration of the loop checks the records of the current iteration against the first iteration, and will dump out the difference. Differences in these two states would be the cause of someone sending a message to the server, thus making a new record and triggering an oddity. Since hexo.in is sitting on a shared hosting server for the moment, the loop will break after a certain amount of calls or time spent in the loop, and tell the client to shoot it another poll. Basically, its telling the client that it wants mo buttah but cant handle the biscuits."
