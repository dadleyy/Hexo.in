    "content" : "Since the last post, I've been working on getting the lobby chat working, which was a requirement for the project. Today, it's safe to say I've gotten that feature to a nice checkpoint. While in the lobby, users are now able to make new chat rooms and join ones that are open already. Site-wide, users are able to continue their conversation in the chatrooms they have joined; you can be reading my blog while talking to your buddies. Hopefully, this will help people communicate to their friends if they are available to play them in a game, and talk %&*# after the game. The design for the rooms took some time, but I ended up trying to mimic the way the facebook chat looks and fixing the windows to the bottom. Probably the hardest part about this process was figuring out the best way to implement the rendering process, since the DOMContentLoaded call happens after the chatrooms are initialized (which happens during parsing). I also ran into some trouble with the underscore templating engine, since it renders the templates into plain html, not a jquery object I can append into the DOM dynamically. Anyways, I'm pretty happy with the way they've turned out cosmetically, but I have a feeling there might be some loose ends I need to tie up on the server side to seal up a few weaknesses. Also, the conversations are currently being stored in json files hidden on the server, so eventually I will need to write some cron-jobs to clean up those files. \r\n \r\n Overall, I'm pretty confident that this bad boy is getting very close to launch-preparedness. For the next few days, I will be spending my time now play-testing and resolving any issues/oversights that come up. I don't expect to be adding any features during this process."
