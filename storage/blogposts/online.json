    "content" : "Want to know who else is online, so you can target somone special for some hexagonal thrashing? Well, with the addition of the new \"online now\" list on your home page, you can do just that. Ironically, one of the features that is required for this capstone project is a list of users that are currently online, so that other users can send invitations to one of their friends to play with them. I wasn't really planning on implmenting something like this, and I didn't really notice it was actually a requirement...I really need to start keeping the handouts from class. After spending some time today working out some of the scaffolding for the feature, I actually have a good chunk of this component knocked out. Part of that meant adding the underscore.js library to my code, so I can take advantage of it's nice templating engine, since there are a lot of DOM updates going on. I've worked with underscore before, and it gets the job done very well, for being such a lightweight file. So far I haven't really had a need to use any of the other functionality it provides, but I am sure it will come in handy at some point. I still need to update the database schema so games can be flagged as \"private\", so you won't have any john doe jumping in your challenge match. After that, it's a pretty straight shot to getting the rest of the feature hooked up. \r\n \r\n Hopefully, I can have this up and running by the end of this weekend, and then I will be be able to focus on the actual game logic and maybe test out a few games sometime next week. From my experience with game development, there should be alot of play testing to make sure the thing is actually fun before the deadline. It would be a very sad say if this concept turned out to be a bust!"
