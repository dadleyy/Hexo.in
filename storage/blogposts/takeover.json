    "content" : "The past week or so, I've been putting most of my time on this project into getting the game system up and running. A lot of the work for this was pretty similar to the chat system, since I'm using json files to store the states of the game tiles, and a socket to keep track of when things get updated. The difficult part of getting the system working was actually coming to the final decision on the game; after 5 weeks, I've finally make up my mind about what I want to make.  It turns out I am going to go a 501 style game, with the ability to take over nearby game pieces from your opponent by having more than 3 of his piece's neighbors be your own. Kinda like the game called hexagon, where you're either a ruby or a gem. I still have a lot of things to hash out, like other curve-balls, the win condition, and the code to check the win condition, but I'm pretty happy with the way things have turned out so far. Eventually I am going to have to revisit some of my templates because I've started to notice some annoying flaws with my UI that make the game less fun. \r\n\r\n While I was working on the game features, my eye ended up being caught by the html5 geolocation feature, and I decided to have some fun with it. I ended up combining the api with google maps for a little styled map in the header that shows visitors' location. There is still some middle-ground to hash out, but ideally, combined with the \"online now\" feature, there is potential for a nice real-time geo-data viz for online users. This will probably be a bonus feature that will be implemented after I finish the project, but I am stoked for it anyways! Stay tuned for it."
